    This summer, I've been working on updating my Game of Life site. I looked at several JavaScript frameworks, but was not satisfied with the performance of any of them. I could've used my own miq lilbrary, but that mimicks the jQuery API too much.
When you write in native DOM, you probably use document.querySelectorAll(selector) a lot. After a while, you probably write a helper function like this:
const $ = (selector, dom) => Array.from((dom || document).querySelectorAll(selector));
But writing c…

    <p class="datum">Saturday 25 April 2020 at 17:31</p>

    In HTML and JavaScript, you can easily apply some styling with the style attribute or property. But if you just want to pass a value, like a color, style falls short.
Fortunately, there is a solution for this, which has now been adopted by all
modern browsers: CSS Custom Properties for Cascading Variables,
or CSS variables for short.
How do CSS variables work?
Let's start with an example in CSS:
:root {
  --warning-color: orange;
}

.warning {
  color: var(--warning-color, red);
  border: 1px s…

    Before the year 2000, people who made websites did it all: designing, programming, deployment, SEO et cetera. It didn't take long to figure out that programmers weren't great designers and designers weren't great programmers. Some people where great at both, but they where rare and a statistical coincidence. So the design and programming of websites where assigned to different roles.
Around 2007 a new role emerged: the front-end developer. For a long time, front-end was thought of as easy, some…

    With HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it's not prescribed how to format your code.
Everything on one line or not, lots of spaces, tabs or everything packed
together, for the computer it doesn't really matter.
The result is that everybody will develop its own style. On itself, that isn't bad, but when multiple developers with their own styles will work on the
same code, it will become a bit harder.
With different styles, the code will become harder to read and changes to the
style will pollute the vers…

    A while ago I was working on several websites in a Vagrant container. The problem was that we couldn't test the sites on mobile devices. The IP address of the Vagrant box was known inside my computer, but not outside, on other devices. I could use a proxy like Squid, but it was too big, had to be configured and couldn't be installed with npm, like the other tools. I wrote a simple tool in Node to provide the necessary functionality.
Now, I have complete rewritten the tool, named it testproxy an…

    A nice way to let visitors of your website know about your twitter feed, is to show your latest tweet.
Fortunately, Twitter provides several means to do this. One is the Twitter Widget. Aside from changing some colours, you can't change much of the layout. The second is the Twitter REST API, which gives you a lot of control, but you need a script on the server side.
I don't want to use a server side script, but I do want full control. So none of Twitter's options are suitable for me. So I creat…

    Today I released miq, a tiny jQuery like library. Since the first release of jQuery a lot has changed: lots of array functions, promises, querySelectorAll, CSS transformations... and jQuery can only partially use them because the makers want to keep it backwards compatible.
I created miq to combine the power of jQuery with modern JavaScript.

    On January 12th, 2016, Microsoft stopped supporting Internet Explorer 9 and 10. As a webdeveloper, it might be time to stop supporting IE9 and IE10 too. At the time of writing, in January 2016, the worldwide market share of IE9 and IE10 is less than 1.3% for each browser. Check the statistics from your own site, because the IE usage on your site might even be less.
Two years earlier, Microsoft already stopped support for IE8. At that time I wrote an article about which features you can use

    &quot;The saddest thing of being a frontend developer is getting designs that could've been for print. Every time.&quot;
When I started making websites in 1994, all designs I got could just as well been used for print. Okay, there where some buttons and a form, but that's as far as it got regarding interactivity. I thought: &quot;once the designers learn about the possibilities of the web, they'll make the designs more interactive&quot;.
Years later, in 2005, I was part of a small team creating…

    Lea Verou's new book CSS Secrets is for frontend webdevelopers who use CSS in their daily work. The book assumes you already know, for example, CSS2 selectors, transforms and ::before/::after pseudo elements. But the book is still useful if you don't. You do need to have a basic understanding of CSS, so if you're still struggling with position: relative and position: absolute, you'll better start with a beginner level book.
The book shows 47 &quot;CSS Secrets&quot;: problems you might encounter…
