	I'm a technology-enthiousiast. When I see a new technology, I want to try it, use it, master it. Unfortunately, a day only has 24 hours, from which a large part is gone when asleep. So I had to make some choices. When I saw the Internet for the first time, I was hooked. Mind you, that was in a terminal, browsers didn't exsist at that time. At least I could focus on a manageable set of technologies.</p>
<p>
	But not for long. Java, Flash, JavaScript, CSS, and recently stuff like Node.js and WebGL to name a few, makes it impossible to grasp it all. Now I'm settling a bit with HTML(5), CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. Pretty much mainstream, but as a freelancer, you can't go too wild.</p>
<p>
	In my work or with my own little projects, I sometimes stumble on some interesting uses of technology. Or I have an opinion about something. Or I think some technology is <span class="short_text" id="result_box"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" title="onderbelicht">underexposed. I want to write them down, for use for everybody. And maybe, sometimes, as a reference for myself. So I started this blog. Let me know what you think about it. And when you see a spelling error, you can also let me know, English is not my first language.</span></span></p>

I live there with my wife <a href="https://jolie.nl/">Jolie</a> and two daughters L. and Rosalie.</p>
